# Why I created this project

<h3> I decided to do push ups every day for as long as i can, so i started tracking my "Push up journey" <br> in 
samsung notes, but i wanted to save my progress in someplace where storing data is reliable.

The first thing that came to mind was Notion, as I was (and am) using it on daily basis.</h3>

## Current Features :

- <h4>Create Notion Database (with schema) in a given Notion page</h4>
- <h4>Convert my personal note-taking format to what fits Notion's API</h4>
- <h4>Populate the Notion database with data <h5>this one is a bit shaky because i'm making a request for every item added.<h5> </h4>

## Planning To Add :

- <h4>A better way to add items to the Notion database (if possible)</h4>

## What my format looks like in Samsung Notes :

    20 aug - 51,25,20 time: 3:12-3:21 didn't count
    21 aug - 46,27,21  time: 00:23-00:33
    22 aug - 22,37,20,21,12  time: 02:08-02:20

<h5>The reason for the "didn't count" keyword is that sometimes during doing the pushups i forget to count lol</h5>

## Packages used :

- python-dotenv
- json
- os
- requests
